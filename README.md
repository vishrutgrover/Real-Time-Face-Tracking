# Real-Time-Face-Tracking
The purpose of this is to create a stable system of real-time face detection inside a live video feed. Positioning of the face detection module of the system should be highly efficient in detecting and tracking faces, and to minimize the lag as much as possible for optimal functionality.

## Models Implemented
1) Mediapipe Holistic Detection for Single Face
2) BlazeFace Model for Multi Face Detection using Mediapipe (Single Shot Detector (SSD))
3) Haar Cascade Classifier using OpenCV
4) Face Recognition Module (Detection as well as labelling faces with a single example)
